    <h1>Privacy Policy for Expense Management</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 28th Oct 2025</p>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Expense Management</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) collects, uses, and protects your personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use the Expense Management app, we may collect the following information:</p>

      <li><strong>Group Data:</strong> Information related to groups you create or join.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device details (such as model and OS version) used for improving app performance and analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Anonymous identifiers used by ad networks to show relevant banner ads.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any banking, card, or payment information.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate your account and allow you to log in securely.</li>
      <li>Store and display your expense data and reports.</li>
      <li>Provide and improve app functionality through our backend hosted.</li>
      <li>Display banner ads to support app maintenance and development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your information is securely stored in our backend system hosted. We use encryption and access control to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, please note that no online system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>The app displays <strong>banner ads</strong> through third-party ad networks (such as Google AdMob). These ad networks may use cookies or device identifiers to provide non-personalized ads. You can learn more about Google’s advertising privacy practices at:</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data with any external party except:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When required by law or government authorities.</li>
      <li>With trusted service providers (like Render.com) used only to host and operate the app backend.</li>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not designed for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Expense Management</strong> is an informational tool for tracking and managing expenses. It does not involve real financial transactions, payments, or money transfers. Therefore, the app does not cause any financial loss to users.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on our website with an updated effective date.</p>
